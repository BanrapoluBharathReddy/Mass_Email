# Mass_Email
This project is a serverless mass email sender built using AWS Lambda and S3. It allows users to upload email recipient lists to an S3 bucket, which triggers a Lambda function to send bulk emails via a chosen email service. The architecture is scalable, cost-effective, and fully automated, making it ideal for large-scale email campaigns.
